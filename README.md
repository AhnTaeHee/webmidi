## Introduction

**WebMidi.js** makes it easy to interact with MIDI instruments directly from a web browser or from 
Node.js. It simplifies the control of physical or virtual MIDI instruments with user-friendly 
functions such as `playNote()`, `setPitchBend()` or `sendControlChange()`. It also allows reacting 
to inbound MIDI messages by adding listeners for events such as `"noteon"`, `"pitchbend"` or 
`"programchange"`.

## Browser Support

The library works in all browsers that natively support the 
[Web MIDI API](https://webaudio.github.io/web-midi-api/). Currently, the following major browsers
have native support: 

* Edge
* Chrome
* Opera

It is also possible to use this library in other browsers if you install 
[Jazz-Plugin](https://jazz-soft.net/download/Jazz-Plugin/) v1.4+. This combination provides 
support for the following additional web browsers:

* Firefox
* Safari
* Internet Explorer

## Node.js Support

Version 3.0 of WebMidi.js introduced full Node.js support. Nothing special needs to be done, it 
should just work in the following environments:

* GNU/Linux
* macOS
* Windows
* Raspberry Pi

Support for the Node.js environment has been made possible by the good folks of 
[Jazz-Soft](https://jazz-soft.net/) via their [JZZ](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jzz) module.

## Flavours

To cater to various needs, WebMidi.js is distributed in 3 different flavours which you can find 
inside the `dist` folder: 

* **Immediately invoked function expression** (IIFE): This version creates a `WebMidi` object 
directly in the global namespace. This is the legacy approach which is often easier for beginners.

* **ES6 Module** (ESM): This is the modern approach which allows you to `import` the objects as
needed.

* **CommonJS Module** (CJS): this is the flavour used by Node.js and often with bundling tools 
such as WebPack.

All 3 flavours also come in a minified version with sourcemap.

## Installation

Depending on your needs and environment, you can install **WebMidi.js** in a variety of different 
ways.

#### CDN

The easiest way to get started is to link the WebMidi.js library from the 
[jsDelivr](https://www.jsdelivr.com/package/npm/webmidi) CDN (content delivery network). Just add 
this `<script>` tag to your HTML page:

    <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/webmidi@3.0.0-alpha.1/dist/webmidi.iife.js"></script>

#### Manual Install

Obviously, you can also install **WebMidi.js** the old-fashioned way by downloading the
[latest release](https://github.com/djipco/webmidi/releases) packaged as a zip file. Uncompress the
package, grab the `./dist/webmidi.iife.js` file and copy it to your project. Link to it from your 
HTML page using a `<script>` tag as usual. 

#### NPM Install

Arguably, the easiest approach is to install **WebMidi.js** with NPM. At the root of your project, 
simply issue the following command to perform the install:

    npm install webmidi@next
    
Then, you can use any of those approaches depending on your environment:

    // Script tag
    <script src="node_modules/dist/webmidi.iife.js"></script>
 
    // CommonJS require
    const {WebMidi} = require("webmidi");
 
    // ES module import
    import {WebMidi} from "node_modules/dist/webmidi.esm.js";

## Insecure Origins

Starting with version 77, 
[Chrome deprecated Web MIDI usage on insecure origins](https://www.chromestatus.com/feature/5138066234671104). 
This means that, going forward, any page using WebMidi.js will need to be hosted on a secure origin:

* `https://`
* `localhost:`
* `file:///`

Also, the user will need to explicitely authorize usage via a prompt (no matter if system exclusive
messages are used or not).

## Quick Start

Getting started is easy. The first thing to do is to enable **WebMidi.js**. To do that, you call
`WebMidi.enable()` and use `then()` to pass it a function to execute when done:

```javascript
WebMidi
  .enable()
  .then(() => console.log("WebMidi enabled!"))
  .catch(err => alert(err));
```
To interact with devices you need to know which `Input` and `Output` ports are available. Connect a
MIDI device and try the following:

```javascript
WebMidi
  .enable()
  .then(onEnabled)
  .catch(err => alert(err));

function onEnabled() {
  console.log(WebMidi.inputs);
  console.log(WebMidi.outputs);
}
```

Inputs and outputs all have a `channels` property containing an array of 16 `InputChannel` or 
`OutputChannel` objects. 

Here is a quick example of how to play a note on MIDI channel 1 of the first found output device 
(port):

```javascript
let synth = WebMidi.outputs[0];
synth.channels[1].playNote("C3");
```

Above, we retrieve the port in the `outputs` array and store it inside the `synth` variable. Then,
we access MIDI channel 1 of the synth and use its `playNote()` method.

Since the position of devices in the array could change, it is often better to use the device's 
name (as displayed in the `WebMidi.outputs` array):

```javascript
let synth = WebMidi.getOutputByName("Axiom Pro 25 Ext Out");
synth.channels[1].playNote("C3");
```

Receiving MIDI messages works in a similar way: you retrieve the `Input` device you want to use, and
then add a callback function to be triggered when a specific MIDI message is received on the desired
channel. For example, to listen for pitch bend events on channel 1 of the device:

```javascript
let input = WebMidi.getInputByName("Axiom Pro 25 USB A In");

input.channels[1].addListener('pitchbend', e => {
 console.log("Pitch value: " + e.value);
});
```

## API Documentation

The [API for WebMidi.js](https://webmidijs.org/docs/) is fully documented and I take 
pride in maintaining good API documentation. If you spot an error (even something minor) or think a 
topic should be made clearer, do not hesitate to 
[file an issue](https://github.com/djipco/webmidi/issues) or, better yet, send a PR. 

Here is a link to the full
**[API Reference](https://webmidijs.org/docs/)**. You can also find the API reference inside the 
`docs` folder.

## About Sysex Support

Per the 
[Web MIDI API specification](https://webaudio.github.io/web-midi-api/#dom-navigator-requestmidiaccess), 
system exclusive (sysex) support is disabled by default. If you need to use sysex messages, you will 
need to explicitly enable them:

```javascript
WebMidi.enable({sysex: true});
```

## Feature Request

If you would like to request a new feature, enhancement or API change, please check if it is not 
already planned for an upcoming version by checking the 
[Wiki](https://github.com/djipco/webmidi/wiki). Then, discuss it in the 
[Enhancement Proposals](https://webmidijs.org/forum/categories/enhancements) section of the forum.
